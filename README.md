- LLM Summary of Abstract: _The open data movement revolutionizes mineralogy, enabling exploration of new topics like mineral ecology and evolution. Availability of open data, coupled with data science and mineralogy expertise, leads to significant discoveries. Feedback highlights the need for better FAIRness (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) of open data. This paper discusses recent efforts to build Mindat's open data service, enhancing data quality and establishing a machine interface for data access. OpenMindat aims to meet researchers' increasing data needs in mineralogy, providing an internationally recognized, FAIR-compliant database to accelerate scientific discoveries._

- LLM Summary of Abstract: _"Introducing K2, the first large language model (LLM) for geoscience, along with GeoSignal, a dataset for aligning LLM responses to geoscience queries, and GeoBench, the first geoscience LLM benchmark. The LLaMA-7B model was fine-tuned on 5.5B tokens of geoscience text, including 1M+ literature pieces, and equipped K2 with geoscience abilities. The approach and datasets, along with all training data and model checkpoints, are open-sourced at [link]."_

### ['How do I get my API Key?' article on Mindat.org by Jiyin Zhang](https://www.mindat.org/a/how_to_get_my_mindat_api_key "'How do I get my API Key?' article on Mindat.org by Jiyin Zhang")

Source: https://www.mindat.org/a/how_to_get_my_mindat_api_key

- The first step in getting started with the Mindat API
- The article "How do I get my API Key?" explains how a user can obtain a key
- An API "key" is a long string of letters and numbers that uniquely identifies the user when they are interacting with the Mindat API. 
- The article has several thousand views (which is a metric to the interest in the extended function of Mindat). 


### [Mindat API Specification page in .YAML format through OpenAPI](https://api.mindat.org/schema/redoc/ "Mindat's API Access Points")

Source: https://api.mindat.org/schema/redoc/

- The API endpoints are downloadable as a .YAML file above and are in OpenAPI format
- Start here if you are a developer or in need of accessing the Mindat API endpoints directly. 


###  Mindat.org's Current Search Functionality

- Depending on context, you may not need to use the full search functions of the Mindat API! See the advanced search functions below for 
 
 - [Mindat's Full Search Menu](https://www.mindat.org/searchmenu.php)
 - [Search Minerals By Chemistry](https://www.mindat.org/chemsearch.php)
 - [Advanced Search](https://www.mindat.org/advanced_search.php)


### Mineralogical Data from Mindat.org with Python & R

If you are using Python or R for Data Science, there are completed packages ready for use with the Mindat API.

- [OpenMindat CRAN Package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/OpenMindat/index.html "Mindat API R Package")
- [OpenMindat Python Package](https://github.com/ChuBL/OpenMindat/wiki)

### Mineralogical Data from Mindat.org without the Python or R Programming Languages

Right now the Mindat API is most accessible through R and Python. However, anyone who can use Excel can get started with Python or R.

#### Mindat.org through Python for absolute Beginners

First, download the Python programming language at Python.org. Next, visit this URL (https://colab.research.google.com/github/ChuBL/How-to-Use-Mindat-API/blob/main/How_to_Use_Mindat_API.ipynb ) With no programming experience whatsoever, you can follow the steps within this Jupyter Notebook to get started with the API. 



### How can I download the full Mindat database to a local copy? 

The current footprint of the total Mindat database is measurable in gigabytes. It's lighter than a backpack full of those same geomaterials !

üöß Items I would like to add to this guide: 
- Downloading the entire Mindat database to a local copy.
- Verifying a local database has the most correct information



#
# Machine Interfaces with Mindat Database

It is important to make a distinction in the usage of the Mindat API: querying and downloading data from the Mindat website is _not_ the same as data analytics and data science with the mineralogy data. R and Python allow for both. 


## [OpenMindat - Quickly Retrieve Datasets from the 'mindat.org' API](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/OpenMindat/index.html "Mindat API R Package")
##### "An R package for querying and accessing open data from the Mindat API."
- Source: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/OpenMindat/index.html
- Author(s): Xiang Que [aut, cre], Xiaogang Ma [aut]
- "Allows access to the Mindat.org resources through the R programming language for data science activities."
- ‚≠ê


## [OpenMindat Python](https://github.com/ChuBL/OpenMindat/wiki)
### An OpenMindat Python package in active development
### https://github.com/ChuBL/OpenMindat/wiki
- "This is a test version of the OpenMindat Python package, designed to facilitate querying and retrieving data on minerals and geomaterials from the Mindat API."
- An excellent resource with documentation.
- Author(s): Jiyin Zhang

## Comma Separated Values (.csv) from the Mindat 

üöß Not all people interested in using the Mindat API are familar with the programming of digital computers. There are many great resources for folks to learn and anyone interested can get started within an hour. However, the usecase of Mindat to .CSV outputs is important and I think that the Mindat API can facilitate this. At present, Python and R are the only completed official implementations.




### Downloading from Mindat.org with JavaScript in the Browser

üöß

The API for Mindat.org removes the need for web scraping. While you can use web-scraping methods on the Mindat.org website [example of old web scraper](https://github.com/MelorGloom/Crystal-Info-Scrapper/blob/main/main.py "Mindat Web Scraper on Github.com"), this method is now outdated and it. 


### The Julia Programming Language for Mindat

The Julia Programming Language is capable of data science activities alongside or in parallel with Python and R. Anything that can be used for data science activities with the Mindat API should be used for data science activities !

There exists an R package that allows calls to the Julia lang from R (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/JuliaCall/readme/README.html). 

There exists a Julia package that allows calls to Python package that may be interoperable with the Python Mindat package. The Julia package may be found at (https://juliahub.com/ui/Packages/General/PyCall). 
 
### Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with the Mindat.org Database

- A language model (LLM) toolchain could, if connected to the internet, query the Mindat database for factual retrieval of geomaterial properties. 
 
- RAG functionality with Mindat's data would be excellent for systems that would otherwise confabulate answers pertaining to geomaterials, localities, etc. 
- ‚ö†Ô∏è ¬©Ô∏è ‚ùî Fair use and commercial applications are outside the scope of this document. Please respect the Mindat team and researchers.

- Could there be a more effecient method to encode mineralogy data into a LLM dataset like K2? 
    


### The Rust Programming Language

Running Rust via web-assembly  may be usable through WebAssembly to handle JSON from the Mindat server. 

- Rust can enable command line functionality for queries, such as a bash script, that can be useful when for users looking for a single page of results.
- Rust may be helpful in parsing the JSON responses from the server
