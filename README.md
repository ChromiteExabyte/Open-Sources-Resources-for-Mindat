This page has resources, links, and guides relating to the Mindat.org mineralogy database and its new application program interface (API). This API establishes many practical affordances to those working with mineralogical data. The context, improvements, and changes relating to Mindat and the API can be found in paper "OpenMindat" which is linked to in the first section below. 

This is a community maintained repository and is not affiliated with any of the projects below. This GitHub repository does contain links to other resources and further resources, but this repository is not thoroughly cited yet.

For those interested in using the API, there is an official tutorial on this webpage. As of April 10th 2024, the article has 3,125 views!

### [Mindat API Specification page in .YAML format through OpenAPI](https://api.mindat.org/schema/redoc/ "Mindat's API Access Points")

The specification for the API can be found at https://api.mindat.org/schema/redoc/ and is downloadable as a .YAML file. The Mindat API can be used with the R and Python packages as well as proprietary packages. 


###  Mindat.org's Current Search Functionality


- [Mindat's Full Search Menu](https://www.mindat.org/searchmenu.php)
- [Search Minerals By Chemistry](https://www.mindat.org/chemsearch.php)
- [Advanced Search](https://www.mindat.org/advanced_search.php)

#### Random Mineral, Random Locality 

The `Random Mineral` and `Random Locality` search options run a PHP script that generates a pseudorandom query.


### Downloading the full Mindat database 

The current footprint of the total Mindat database is measurable in gigabytes. While it is lighter than having all of those geomaterials in a backback, there are still considerations of storage and data handling that must be undertaken.

# Machine Interfaces with the for the Mindat Database

The API for Mindat.org removes the need for web scraping. While you can use web-scraping methods on the Mindat.org website [example of old web scraper](https://github.com/MelorGloom/Crystal-Info-Scrapper/blob/main/main.py "Mindat Web Scraper on Github.com"), this method is now outdated. 

It is important to make a distinction in the usage of the Mindat API: querying and downloading data from the Mindat website is _not_ the same as data analytics and data science with the mineralogy data.
