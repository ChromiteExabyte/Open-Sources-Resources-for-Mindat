# Open-Source Resources for Mindat, Data Science, and Earth Sciences 
## ðŸª¨

#### ðŸš§ This page is under construction ðŸš§

This page has resources and links to projects relating to Mindat.org's API, OpenMindat, and the intersection of data + Earth science. This is a community maintained repository and is not affiliated with any of the projects below. 

The website Mindat.org has implemented an Application Program Interface (API). For more information, please see the link below.

1) Retrieving 




## The R Programming Language
### OpenMindat R Package
##### "An R package for querying and accessing open data from the Mindat API."
- Source: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/OpenMindat/index.html
- Author(s): Xiang Que [aut, cre], Xiaogang Ma [aut]
- Allows access to the Mindat.org resources through the R programming language for data science activities. 



## The Python Programming Language 

The Python programming language exists. It's well suited for


## OpenMindat Python 
### An OpenMindat Python package in active development
### https://github.com/ChuBL/OpenMindat/wiki
- "This is a test version of the OpenMindat Python package, designed to facilitate querying and retrieving data on minerals and geomaterials from the Mindat API."
- An excellent resource with documentation.
- Author(s): Jiyin Zhang

### Learning Python for Data Science and Mineralogy 

Python is a programming language that is accessible and well-suited for data science. 
If you are new to computer programming, Python is an excellent choice. 

- FreeCodeCamp.com has an interactive "Scientific Computing With Python" course.
  
- The 'Python IDLE' is a programming environment officially associated with the Python language. It is an a the faste way to get started. 






### JavaScript for Mineralogical Data Science

JavaScript is not a programming language, technically.

### Possible exporting

Some combination of Rust / JavaScript / Python / R / etc ... existing on the mindat server could allow someone to work with Comma Separated Values (.csv) files for use in something like Excel, VisiCalc, GoogleSheets, or Libre Spreadsheets. Having a tool here could help non-programmers work with .csv files and perhaps be a good introduction to data science tools? This notion is 1) an education opportunity 2) an accessibility thing for non-programmers and 3) something for consideration on the backend of the OpenMindat server. 

R and Python are excellent first packages to implement OpenMindat.
