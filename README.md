# Open-Source Resources for Mindat, Data Science, and Earth Sciences 
## ü™®

#### üöß This page is under construction üöß

This page has resources, links, and guides relating to the Mindat.org mineralogy database and its new application program interface (API). This API establishes many practical affordances to those working with mineralogical data. The context, improvements, and changes relating to Mindat and the API can be found in paper "OpenMindat" (Accessible at https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/gdj3.204) 

This is a community maintained repository and is not affiliated with any of the projects below. This GitHub repository does contain links to other resources and further resources, but this repository is not thoroughly cited yet.

For those interested in using the API for any purposes, there are two ways to

### Mindat API Specification 

The specification for the API can be found at https://api.mindat.org/schema/redoc/ and is downloadable as .YAML


### Queries Currently Available through Mindat.org's Website 


#### Search Minerals By Chemistry

https://www.mindat.org/chemsearch.php

#### Advanced Mineral Search

https://www.mindat.org/advanced_search.php

#### Random Mineral, Random Locality 

The `Random Mineral` and `Random Locality` search options run a PHP script that generates a pseudorandom query.




### Downloading the full Mindat database 

The current footprint of the total Mindat database is (?)GB.

# Machine Interfaces for the Mindat Database

There are two distinct things that can be done with this API and such: 

1) Retrieving the data from the website 
2) Manipulation and analysis of that data


## OpenMindat R Package
##### "An R package for querying and accessing open data from the Mindat API."
- Source: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/OpenMindat/index.html
- Author(s): Xiang Que [aut, cre], Xiaogang Ma [aut]
- "Allows access to the Mindat.org resources through the R programming language for data science activities."
- R Markdown also !



## OpenMindat Python 
### An OpenMindat Python package in active development
### https://github.com/ChuBL/OpenMindat/wiki
- "This is a test version of the OpenMindat Python package, designed to facilitate querying and retrieving data on minerals and geomaterials from the Mindat API."
- An excellent resource with documentation.
- Author(s): Jiyin Zhang

### Possible exporting

Some combination of Rust / JavaScript / Python / R / etc ... existing on the mindat server could allow someone to work with Comma Separated Values (.csv) files for use in something like Excel, VisiCalc, GoogleSheets, or Libre Spreadsheets. Having a tool here could help non-programmers work with .csv files and perhaps be a good introduction to data science tools? This notion is 1) an education opportunity 2) an accessibility thing for non-programmers and 3) something for consideration on the backend of the OpenMindat server. 

R and Python are excellent first packages to implement OpenMindat.
