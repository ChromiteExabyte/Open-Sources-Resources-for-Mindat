# The Python Language for Mineral Data Science
## OpenMindat Python 
### An OpenMindat Python package in active development
### https://github.com/ChuBL/OpenMindat/wiki
- "This is a test version of the OpenMindat Python package, designed to facilitate querying and retrieving data on minerals and geomaterials from the Mindat API."
- An excellent resource with documentation.

### Learning Python for Data Science and Mineralogy 

Python is a programming language that is accessible and well-suited for data science. If you are new to 
 FreeCodeCamp.com has resources for those new to and learning Python. The Python IDLE is the fastest way to get started. 

```Python
# This is what the Python programming language looks like

# Define a variable
x = 5

# Print the variable
print(x)

# Here the console 
```



# The R Programming Language for Mindat Data Science
## OpenMindat R Package
#### "An R package for querying and accessing open data from the Mindat API."
- Source: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/OpenMindat/index.html
- Author(s): Xiang Que [aut, cre], Xiaogang Ma [aut]
- Allows access to the Mindat.org resources through the R programming language for data science activities.

# Rust for Mineralogical Data Science

The Rust Programming Langauge exists! ðŸ¦€ I don't yet know *how* structs and enums can be applied to minerals in a datascience context but I know that Rust can be an effective tool here. 

## Exporting Mineral Data from a Web Query Builder

Some combination of Rust / JavaScript / Python / R / etc ... existing on the mindat server could allow someone to work with Comma Separated Values (.csv) files for use in something like Excel, VisiCalc, GoogleSheets, or Libre Spreadsheets. Having a tool here could help non-programmers work with .csv files and perhaps be a good introduction to data science tools? This notion is 1) an education opportunity 2) an accessibility thing for non-programmers and 3) something for consideration on the backend of the OpenMindat server. 

R and Python are excellent first packages to implement OpenMindat.
